This is a description of the quirks noticed while studying the telemator database. I might have forgotten some, so please contact me if you have any questions.

The most noteworthy quirk I have found is that the details of a circuit is not stored anywhere, but inferred from multiple tables by some insane logic they have implemented in their software. I opted to not recreate the same logic when displaying them in my webpage, but instead iterated over the circuits and made the new table with the data i found, based on some assumptions i made. It might be necessary to actually do the same as the original telemator program, but I'm hesitant to make that change, as the logic seems far too complex to be maintanable over time.

Another quirk, which should't affect the work with the telemator-nav integration, is that the reference-name for cables in telemator is not stored in the database at all. It is probably generated by taking the start-point and end-point with a dash inbetween, which it looked like for the cable I looked at.

No proper foreign key is used in the database, all relations are managed by the software. In addition, the database is not normalized. UtsUtg, which is the table for ports on equipment, has a reference to both card and end(equipment or room).
